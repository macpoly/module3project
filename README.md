# module3project

This repo contains two files related to the Coursera Data Science Module 3 Project:
- An R script, run_analysis.R
- A code book, CodeBook.md
 
The R script is meant to be applied to the UC Irvine Human Activity Recognition data file, available in .zip format from the Coursera project page. You first need to dowload that file and unzip it.  The R script assumes that your working directory is the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, within which are some files such as "activity_levels.txt" and two sub-folders called "test" and "train".
